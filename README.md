# Would You Rather

This project is a proof-of-concept game that demonstrates complex state management in a React-Redux store. You can login as one of 3 users and vote on questions, create questions, as well as look at history. The datastore API is static and resets on reloads. Deatiled project specs are outlined below.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
